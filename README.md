# Koller Investments Website

Welcome, 

This project was carried out within the framework of my first Milestone Project for the Full-Stack Web Development Diploma from the Code Institute.  

Used technologies include  HTML5, CSS3 and a little of JS mostly from Bootstrap to demonstrate my personal skills and acquired knowledge from this online program. 

Code was written mostly on my own but a some libraries were taken as well to improve functionality and CSS. 

I will be glad to hear your feedback about your experience using this website.

## UX


![Responsive Views of Home Page](documentation/responsive-home-koller.png)

The main objective was to create a custom website for a landlord company called Koller Investments that rents different properties. The company needed online presence and a presentation card for other companies or even banks that inquiry about Koller Investments. Their current site is hosted on Google Sites [Koller Investments](https://inversiones-koller.business.site/) but it is not informative enough.

The website also should give customers, the tenants, confidence on what the company can do and its cusomer care. 

This importance for a new website was identified through some User Stories like the following:

- "As a new comer in the city, I would like to know which properties are available at the moment for rent depending on their location. It would be great to have an overview map where I can narrow down my options and reserve the one the option that I like."

- "As a current customer from the company, I would like to know if Koller Investments has other options for office properties available where we can move our office due to expansion. That means information like space is important for us."

- "I am working in a bank granting credits to small companies. I woud like a webiste where I can easily read who they area and what services they offer so I can assess the risk of a new loan."

The website was first designed using a wireframe which can be found on miro.com under this link:

## Features

The website is composed by tree main pages among which customers can navigate to find the information they need or achieve the objective that they have. IMPORTANT: At the moment most of the content is shown as generic Lorem Ipsum text but will be corrected as the company provides this infromation!
 
### Existing Features
- About-Us and Our-Services Sections - allows users to inform themselves about the company and understand what the company can offer. 
- Our Properties-Section - provides information about the types of properties that tenants can reserve. 
- Our Properties-Map - This feature will allow customers to find the property option that best suits their location needs. Location is the main criteria in this city, so they will select those mostly based on that criteria. This feature is partially inabled because the back-end development is missing to make the map interactive. 
- Reservaton Form - This will enable users to reserve the property of their selection and enter their information to ellaborate a renting contract. 
- Contact Form - For potential new clients or simply interested individuals who inquiry about the company. 

In addition, these are the plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Back-end development - Overall this development is still missing to make the map interactive and collect the data from the reservation and contact forms. 
- Online Tenant Portal - This internet portal is important for current customers to find and manage their renting contracts, browse their payment history, report issues to the company and others. 

## Technologies Used

- [Google Map JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
    - The property map was created using **Google Maps** and some markers were added. Personal API Key used.
